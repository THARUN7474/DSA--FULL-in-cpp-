# **Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Course Plan**  
**Source:** [Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Course Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)  

For any question, I will refer to online articles to explore different approaches.  

---

### **Approach to Solving Problems**  

- I am following the course step-by-step, from arrays to all topics.  
- I will first solve all **easy problems** in each topic before moving on to medium and hard ones.  
- Once **all easy problems in all modules are done**, I will move on to **medium and hard problems**.  
  - **For Graphs, DP, Tries, and Advanced Topics,** I will spend extra time, ensuring **double revision and deeper understanding**.  
- I will **open the question directly, analyze it, and give my best effort to solve it** within a reasonable time.  
- If I cannot solve a problem, I will **watch a video explanation** and then try to solve it again on my own.  
- I will mark:  
  - Questions that I need to **revise later**.  
  - Questions that I found **important or tricky** to revisit.  
  - Questions that solved after watching lecture 

---

### **Daily Routine for Solving Problems**  

1. **Revision Before Solving**  
   - Before solving new problems, I will **review the previous dayâ€™s completed problems**, including:  
     - The code I wrote.  
     - The logic and thought process.  
     - Dry runs of the solutions.  
   
2. **Solving Process**  
   - Read the problem statement and constraints carefully.  
   - Think of a **brute force solution** first.  
   - Perform **dry runs** with some test cases.  
   - Code the solution and debug errors.  
   - Optimize the solution if possible.  
   - Check for **edge cases** before submitting.  
   - TC AND SC ---knwoing and analysing 
   - **Store all solutions locally on my laptop** and push them to **GitHub** after completing the dayâ€™s problems.  

---

### **Revision Plan**  

- After completing all **easy problems in a module**, I will **revise all easy problems**:  
  1. **Step 1:** Read the problem statement and **recall the thought process**.  
  2. **Step 2:** Check my previous **code** and logic.  
  3. **Step 3:** Explore **alternative solutions** and **other approaches** (math concepts, STL methods, optimizations).  
  4. **Step 4:** Solve again the **marked questions** that I found tricky.  



---

### **Overall Revision Schedule**  

- **3rd Revision** (after all easy problems are done):  
  - **In 3 days**, I will review all problems:  
    - Read the question and **recall the logic**.  
    - Go through my **code and solutions**.  
    - Re-solve the **marked questions**.  

- **4th Revision (Monthly Revision at the End of Each Month):**  
  - Review all concepts and questions solved that month.

Your **plan is well-structured, detailed, and highly efficient**â€”you have a solid strategy for learning, revising, and tracking progress. Youâ€™re following a **smart approach** by:  

âœ… **Solving easy problems first** before moving to medium and hard ones.  
âœ… **Double revision for complex topics** like Graphs, DP, and Tries.  
âœ… **Marking questions** for revision and re-solving tricky ones.  
âœ… **Storing solutions** and maintaining a progress tracker.  

### **Can You Complete This in 3 Months?**  
Yes, **itâ€™s possible**, but it depends on:  

1. **Consistency** â€“ You need to solve problems **every day without fail** (or minimize missed days).  
2. **Daily Question Target** â€“ If you aim to **complete 450+ questions** in 90 days, you should solve around:  
   - **5-6 questions daily** (mix of easy, medium, and hard).  
   - **More on weekends or free days** to balance tougher topics.  
3. **Speed & Understanding** â€“ Some topics (like Graphs, DP) may take longer due to deeper concepts, so allocate **extra time** accordingly.  
4. **Time Spent Per Problem** â€“ If you take **too much time per problem**, it can slow you down. Keep your time per question reasonable:  
   - Easy: **15-20 min**  
   - Medium: **30-40 min**  
   - Hard: **1 hour max** (If stuck, see the explanation and reattempt).  
5. **Revision & Retention** â€“ Your plan includes **revisions**, which is great! Stick to it to avoid forgetting concepts.  

### **Suggested Timeline (3-Month Plan)**  
| **Month** | **Focus Areas** | **Goal** |  
|-----------|---------------|---------|  
| **Month 1** | Arrays, Binary Search, Strings, Linked Lists, Recursion | **Finish all Easy + Start Medium** |  
| **Month 2** | Stacks & Queues, Sliding Window, Heaps, Greedy, Trees, BST | **Complete Medium & Start Hard** |  
| **Month 3** | Graphs, DP, Tries, Advanced Topics | **Master Hard & Do Final Revisions** |  

### **Final Answer**  
**Yes, you can finish this in 3 months if you solve 5-6 questions daily and stick to your plan.** Just stay disciplined, focus on **understanding concepts** rather than just solving problems, and donâ€™t skip revisions! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥



### **Plan for 110 Days:**  
| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Topics Covered** | **Target Questions** |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1 (dates)** | **1 Month** | Arrays, Binary Search, Strings, Recursion, LL | **150 Questions** |
| **Phase 2 (dates)** | **1 Month** | Stacks, Queues, Sliding Window, Heaps, Trees, BST, Greedy | **150 Questions** |
| **Phase 3 (dates)** | **1 Month** | Graphs, DP, Tries, Backtracking, Advanced Topics | **150 Questions** |
| **Phase 4 (dates)** | **Final 10 Days** | **Revision + Mock Practice** | **Re-solve weak problems** |

This schedule allows:  
âœ… **Extra buffer time** for difficult topics.  
âœ… **Better revision & mock practice** at the end.  
âœ… **More flexibility** in case of delays or other tasks.  

ðŸš€ **Stick to this plan, and you'll master DSA before your deadline!**
