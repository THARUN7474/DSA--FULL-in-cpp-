Here’s a list of what DFS can do, along with hints and solutions to solve each problem:

---

## **1. Compute a Graph's Minimum Spanning Tree**
### Process:
- Use DFS for finding connected components.
- While traversing, add edges to a spanning tree if they connect unvisited nodes.
- Resulting edges form a spanning tree, but DFS alone doesn’t guarantee minimum weight.
### Hint:
- For a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, use algorithms like **Kruskal’s** or **Prim’s** where DFS is used to verify connectivity or to construct subsets of the graph.

---

## **2. Detect and Find Cycles in a Graph**
### Process:
- Perform DFS and track the parent of each node.
- If a node is revisited and it is **not the parent**, a cycle exists.
- In directed graphs, check back edges during DFS.
### Hint:
- Use a `visited` array and a `recursion stack` for detecting cycles in a **directed graph**.
- Example condition for a cycle: `if (visited[next] && next != parent)`.

---

## **3. Check if a Graph is Bipartite**
### Process:
- Use DFS to color the graph with two colors (e.g., 0 and 1).
- If a neighboring node has the same color during traversal, the graph is not bipartite.
### Hint:
- Maintain a `colors` array initialized to `-1` (unvisited).
- Assign alternate colors during DFS: `colors[neighbor] = 1 - colors[current]`.

---

## **4. Find Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**
### Process:
- Use **Kosaraju’s Algorithm**:
  1. Perform a DFS and store nodes in a stack based on their finishing times.
  2. Reverse the graph (transpose edges).
  3. Perform DFS again using the stack order to find SCCs.
### Hint:
- SCCs can also be found using **Tarjan’s Algorithm**, which uses a low-link value to identify SCCs in a single DFS traversal.

---

## **5. Topologically Sort the Nodes of a Graph**
### Process:
- Perform DFS and store nodes in a stack based on their finishing times (postorder traversal).
- Nodes are added to the stack after visiting all their neighbors.
### Hint:
- Ensure the graph is **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** before applying topological sort.
- The stack gives the topological order in reverse.

---

## **6. Find Bridges and Articulation Points**
### Process:
- Perform DFS while keeping track of discovery times and the lowest reachable node for each node (`low[]` array).
- A **bridge** is an edge where `low[neighbor] > discovery[node]`.
- An **articulation point** is a node where removing it increases the number of connected components.
### Hint:
- Use two arrays:
  - `discovery[]` for the first discovery time of a node.
  - `low[]` for the lowest reachable discovery time from the subtree rooted at the node.

---

## **7. Find Augmenting Paths in a Flow Network**
### Process:
- Use DFS to find a path from the source to the sink with available capacity in a **residual graph**.
- If such a path exists, augment the flow along this path and repeat.
### Hint:
- This is the core of the **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm** for solving the maximum flow problem.
- Maintain a residual capacity matrix to track unused capacity.

---

## **8. Generate Mazes**
### Process:
- Use DFS to randomly visit unvisited neighbors and remove walls between cells to generate a maze.
- Continue until all cells are visited.
### Hint:
- Start at a random cell.
- Use a stack to backtrack when dead ends are encountered.
- Shuffle the neighbor list for randomness.

---

### Notes:
- DFS is versatile and can solve a variety of problems, often requiring additional data structures like stacks, parent arrays, or low-link values.
- Combining DFS with domain-specific logic (e.g., edge weights, bipartite coloring) unlocks solutions to complex graph problems.
